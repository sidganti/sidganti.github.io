# Welcome! &#128075;

This is my personal website and developer portfolio. I made this as a way to consolodate all of my professional links and showcase my personal side-projects.<br>
It is also a fun way for me to explore the basics of web development, hence why I use pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery.<br>
For the style, I tried to create a clean and modern version of the 90's "hacker" aesthetic.

## TODO

1. Add all of my existing projects links and source code.
    - Most of my projects were submitted as class projects so I cannot directly share the source code per class policy.
    - Current idea is to create an altered version of the projects.
2. Make the site mobile compatible.

# Thanks!

Thank you for taking the time to view my site!
